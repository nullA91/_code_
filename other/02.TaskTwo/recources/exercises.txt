exercise 1
write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
the side lengths of the rectangle are entered by the user from the keyboard.

exercise 2
write a program that will ask the user to enter the diameter of a circle
and display the result of calculating the area of a circle and the length
of its circumference on the screen.

exercise 3
write a program that will ask the user to enter an amount in hryvnia and
display the corresponding amount in dollars and euros.
P.S. try to make the result output only 2 digits after the decimal point.

exercise 4
write a program that will ask you to enter the current month (the number of the month as a number)
and display the number of seconds left until the new year (take into account only the month, excluding days and hours).
to simplify calculations, we assume that there are 30 days in each month.
For example: if the user entered November, then 2 months remain until the new year.
The number of seconds in a month can be calculated using the formula:
30 (days) * 24 (hours in a day) * 60 (minutes in an hour) * 60 (seconds in a minute).

exercise 5
the user enters a real number from the keyboard. the program discards all digits
after the second digit after the decimal point and displays separately the integer
part of the number and separately the fractional part. for example,
suppose the user entered the number 23.435342, then the program displays the
integer part (23) and the fractional part (43), which consists of two digits.
