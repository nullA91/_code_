24 and 27, 31 and you’re done.
There was a hungry wolf,
A-searching for his lunch,
He spotted 3 cute homes,
A-sitting in a bunch
The homes of 3 small pigs,
Of hay and bricks and sticks.
He tried to blow their houses down,
but ended in a fix,

Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
